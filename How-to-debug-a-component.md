# How to debug a component
This page explains how to debug a component using `odo` and the according actions in IntelliJ.

The debug action is implemented since version `0.1.2`.

## Supported component types and IntelliJ verisons
The debug action is limited to `java` and `nodejs` component types. 

Debugging `java` components is available in all versions of IntelliJ, however, to debug `nodejs` components, the `JavaScript Debugger` plugin is required and is only available to some licensed versions of IntelliJ.
